We have made a lot of changes to the structure of the project, to make it more suitable for an Integrated Development Environment (we use IntelliJ IDEA).
Further we have moved all inner classes outside, again to make editing and understanding the project easier.

We have created a searchclient/src/dtu/Main.java file, which contains a program which executes our compiled code against the server.
We used this program to run the benchmarks.
As stated in this program the file out/artifacts/searchclient_jar/searchclient.jar contains our compiled client.
