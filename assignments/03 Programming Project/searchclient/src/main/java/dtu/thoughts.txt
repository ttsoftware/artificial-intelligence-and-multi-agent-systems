ASSUMPTIONS:
The HTN planner will never give us an action that can't directly be solved.



Solving preconditions:
    create every possible action that can solve the precondition

Sort the actions by maintaining priority queue with a heuristic

Choosing first action and create preconditions

repeat.


If dead-end: backtrack.
